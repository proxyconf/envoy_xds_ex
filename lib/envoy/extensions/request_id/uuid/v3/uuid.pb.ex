defmodule Envoy.Extensions.RequestId.Uuid.V3.UuidRequestIdConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration for the default UUID request ID extension which has the following behavior:

  1. Request ID is propagated using the :ref:`x-request-id
  <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` header.

  2. Request ID is a universally unique identifier `(UUID4)
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>`_.

  3. Tracing decision (sampled, forced, etc) is set in 14th nibble of the UUID. By default this will
  overwrite existing UUIDs received in the ``x-request-id`` header if the trace sampling decision
  is changed. The 14th nibble of the UUID4 has been chosen because it is fixed to '4' by the
  standard. Thus, '4' indicates a default UUID and no trace status. This nibble is swapped to:

  a. '9': Sampled.
  b. 'a': Force traced due to server-side override.
  c. 'b': Force traced due to client-side request ID joining.

  See the :ref:`x-request-id <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` documentation for
  more information.
